# Operational Aftershock Forecasting (OAF) Server Code and Desktop Applications.

## Downloading

The aftershock forecasting software depends on the [upstream OpenSHA](https://github.com/opensha/opensha) project which should be cloned into the same directory:

```bash
cd ~/opensha    # or whatever directory you choose
git clone https://github.com/opensha/opensha
git clone https://code.usgs.gov/esc/oaf/opensha-oaf
```

Building and running the OAF software requires Java version 11 or higher.

## OAF Server and Analyst Utilities

Developed by:
- Michael Barall, USGS Earthquake Science Center, Moffett Field, CA.
- Nicholas van der Elst, USGS Earthquake Science Center, Pasadena, CA.

USGS information product IP-176538.

The OAF server runs continuously in the cloud, monitoring the USGS ComCat earthquake catalog.
It automatically generates aftershock forecasts and published them on the earthquake event pages.

To build and manage the OAF server, refer to the documentation in [deployment/doc](deployment/doc).

The analyst utilities are GUI programs that are used by analysts to evaluate the operation of the OAF servers,
and make adjustments to the statistical model used by the servers to compute forecasts.

To build analyst utilities for the Reasenberg-Jones statistical model:

```bash
cd opensha-oaf
./gradlew appOAFJar
```

Analyst utilities for the ETAS statistical model are under development.

The analyst utility jar file is created in opensha-oaf/build/libs.

## Aftershock Forecaster

Developed by:
- Nicholas van der Elst, USGS Earthquake Science Center, Pasadena, CA.
- Michael Barall, USGS Earthquake Science Center, Moffett Field, CA.
- Kevin Milner, USGS Geologic Hazards Science Center, Pasadena, CA.

USGS information product IP-177029.

Aftershock Forecaster is a GUI program that runs on the desktop and is used to compute ETAS-based aftershock forecasts.

To build Aftershock Forecaster:

```bash
cd opensha-oaf
./gradlew appOAF_ETAS_Jar
```

The Aftershock Forecaster jar file is created in opensha-oaf/build/libs.
